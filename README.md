# SelfLearn
Self learning from various sources

This reposotory consists of all learnings I do in my free time(or dedicated time for practice)

Data science is a is combination of knowledge and application. My master's studies in data science has given me good head start start on the knowledge front. This reposotory is my way to working on application part.

Rather than worring too much about the perfect handon guide and expeience, I focus on learning and getting things done. 

This is not my professional output, but more like a homework journal. I work on datasets and codes that I encounter during my daily reading time.

I read articles and then practice them on jupyter notebooks. Once I get a hang of the it, I commit and push it here.
